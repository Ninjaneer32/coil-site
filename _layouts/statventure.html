        <div>
            <h5>Phase 1: Concept</h5>
            <p>Propose an idea to improve U.S. Census data sources. The most innovative and promising ideas submitters are selected to join the StatVentures cohort and receive a monetary award to participate. </p>
            <h5>Phase 2: Roadmap</h5>
            <p>Demonstrate the capability and capacity of your idea, with direct collaboration and feedback from the U.S. Census Bureau team. Finalists are selected and receive funding awards to move from roadmap to prototype. Missed phase 1? Don’t worry, new “walk on” teams have the opportunity to join in phases 2 and 3.</p>
            <h5>Phase 3: Demo</h5>
            <p>Build a prototype and test the idea in real world scenarios. Demos are evaluated on their potential to serve the U.S. Census Bureau’s mission and goals, and ultimately have the opportunity to be awarded additional funds and pursue business prospects with the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
